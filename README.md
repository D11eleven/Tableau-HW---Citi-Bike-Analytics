 Citi Bike Observations and Analysis

#1 Generally, ride durations were at highest during weekends, specifically, Saturdays and lowest during mid-week. Only exception was Monday, Sept 6, which was Labor Day 3-day weekend. This information can be useful in staff planning and when conducting promotions from within Citi Bike (i.e. weekend or weekday pass discounts) and with businesses in proximity to bike stations and routes. This trend also may indicate that 'weekend' rides are more of a leisurely type compared to the short rides during the weekday which are most likely of the commute type and/or keeping with the 30min time limit. Recommendation to survey riders on purpose of ride (business, leisure, exercise, etc...) to help target current and potential customers.And this leads to the next point. Useful to know would be what is driving the short duration rides - purpose or 30min limit. Also, How many riders 'link' their ride with multiple bikes so not to go over 30min limit?  

#2 On first glance, it may seem strange that the 'starting station' times and 'ending station' times (depicted in line charts) are very similar. But since, a majority of rides are less than an hour it makes sense that both times are very close. Going back to previous point, it could be valuble insight to know what the purpose is of the short duration rides. Knowing this information could help focus marketing efforts and develop services towards the customer to maintain and improve their overall satisfaction. 

#3 And last, a closer look may be needed to check feasability on some of the lesser utilized bike stations (approx 40 stations had 2 or less rides in September). Would it be more beneficial to move some of these bikes to other stations that may be experiencing shortages in bike availability?
