#1 Ride Durations were at highest during weekends, specifically, Saturdays and lowest during mid-week. Only exception was Monday, Sept 6, which was Labor Day 3-day weekend. This information can be useful in staff planning and when conducting promotions from within Citi Bike (i.e. weekend or weekday pass discounts) and with businesses in proximity to bike stations and routes. This trend also may indicate that 'weekend' rides are more of a leisurely type compared to the short rides during the weekday which are most likely of the commute type. Recommendation to survey riders on purpose of ride (business, leisure, exercise, etc...) to help target current and potential customers.
